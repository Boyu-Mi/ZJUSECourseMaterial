## 9.1

a. Device register is a register used to transfer data between I/O devices and computer.

b. Device data register is a register used to hold the data to be input or output during I/O.

c. Device status register is a register used to save the status of I/O, like if the I/O devices are ready.

## 9.2

The ready bit is used to tell the computer when the input or output comes. If synchronous I/O is used, input or output will come at a const frequency, so the computer will know the time they come. So the ready bit is not necessary.

## 9.9 

If KBSR[15] is 0, the data in KBDR has not been read by computer. If KBDR is written at this time, the data in it will lose.

## 9.10

 If DSR[15] is 0, the monitor electronics is still processing last character, if the DDR is written at this time, the last character may not be displayed correctly.

## 9.14

If the address is xFE02, the address control logic will set the MDR register to the value of KBDR by INMUX.
