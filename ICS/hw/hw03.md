Address is the identity number of memory locations where a data is stored.

Addressability is the number of bits stored in each memory location.

- Memory: store data and instructions.
- Input: get information into computer.
- Output: display the results of processing or other information.
- Processing Unit: carry out the actual processing of information.
- Control Unit: be in charge of making all the other parts of the computer work together.

60 opcodes need at least $log_2{64} = 6$ bits.

32 registers need at least $log_2{32} = 5 $ bits.

There are 32 - 6 - 5 - 5 = 16 bits left for IMM, so the range of the immediate is $2^{-15}$ to $2^{15} - 1$
