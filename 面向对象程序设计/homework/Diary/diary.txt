Today mother and I paid a visit to a famous doctor--Dr Zou.
He talked about something about how to prevent cold with us.
He told us that we should have a good healthy habit, wash our hands before and after meals, 
and take more exercises in our free time, open the windows often to keep the air resh in our house. 
What he said makes me know more about cold. I think we should try our best to do something for it.

I have a dog. Its name is Doggy. I like it.
Doggy has two big eyes, two small ears, a big nose and a small mouth. 
It's black and white. It has a short tail. It's cute and lovely.
Doggy is strong. It likes bones, rice and meat very much. My dog is lazy. 
It can catch a ball. I love my dog very much.
